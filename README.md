Projects for class

I chose to find websites of best-selling authors.  I expected to find many links to amazon, barnes&noble, twitter, etc. 
I did not expect them to reference their own web page so often.  With more time and thinking, I could probably exclude the self-referencing
links, but I didn't worry about it for the purpose of this project.
